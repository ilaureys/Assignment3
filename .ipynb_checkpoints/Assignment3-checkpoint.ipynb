    "# RESEARCH QUESTION\n",
    "<br> How long does it take before the Twitter trend in #EgyptAir will cease to exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "# MOTIVATION & INTRODUCTION\n",
    "<br> Social Media – a phenomenon of the 21st century. To some it is a red flag, but to most it represents an opportunity to engage in communication and to exchange information. Social media platforms include the social network [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook), the video-sharing website [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), the networking service [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn), the mobile photo-sharing service [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) or the microblogging service Twitter. Social media enables participants of its services or networks to simultaneously be producer, distributor and consumer of information. This means that users of social media engage in a flow of information on a scale and at a speed that were previously not possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within seconds of their occurrence, many news events become extremely popular among social media participants. This is especially visible in relation to disaster news, such as the terror attacks in Paris and [Brussels](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35872170). The intense media coverage right after the attacks captured our interest. People around the world shared their views and expressed solidarity with the victims and their families. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the constant flow of information, social media participants are likely to exhibit a limited attention span towards a single topic and are more prone to the symptom of “Quick News”. Hence, we are interested as to how quickly trends in social media can disappear again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate and predict how long it will take for the trend in the Twitter hashtag #EgyptAir to disappear. The hashtag refers to an Egypt Air flight, which was hijacked on March 29 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Twitter? ![alt text](http://www.cambridgema.gov/images/twitter-icon.png)\n",
    "<br> Twitter is an online microblogging service, which enables users to send and read short 140-character messages called “tweets”. Each user chooses to follow certain other users and their “tweets” about news, personal information or links to content such as images, video or articles. Hastags “#” are used to group posts together by a certain topic. “As of May 2015, Twitter has more than 500 million users, out of which more than 332 million are active.” (see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter>)"

    "## METHOD\n",
    "\n",
    "*Twitter data mining and resulting data points* \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we were able to mine [data](#IMPORTING DATA) from Twitter at various hours on Tuesday 29 March 2016, Friday 1 April 2016 and Tuesday 4 April 2016. We found the hashtag #EgyptAir to be trending that day, so we are going to analyze the frequency of mentioning this hashtag (and similar ones) at multiple time periods. Furthermore, we are going to predict the decay in the frequency of the hashtag #EgyptAir by employing a [**linear**](#MODELS) as well as an [**exponential**](#MODELS) decay model."

    "## PRELIMINARY ANSWERS \n",
    "Our [conclusion](#CONCLUSION) is that the hashtag #EgyptAir will cease to exist on different dates depending on the model employed. Given that an exponential decay model fits the data best, the answer to our research question is that the hashtag #EgyptAir will either cease to exist on April 2 at 11.00 or on April 3 at 20.00. "

    "- **Linear** decay shows a constant declining relationship between two variables. In this case we would see a constant declining relationship between *time* on the x-axis and *frequency* on the y-axis. We employ the following simple linear decay model: $$y = f(x) = a - bx$$ where $α > 0$ and $b > 0$ . A linear function has one independent variable and one dependent variable. The independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y. The constant term or the y-intercept is $a$, and it is the value of the dependent variable when x = 0. The coefficient of the independent variable, $b$, is the slope of the function and gives the constant rate of change of the dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponential** decay shows a relative declining relationship between two variables. In this case we would see a relative declining relationship between *time* on the x-axis and *frequency* on the y-axis. Exponential decay models decrease very rapidly, and then level off to become asymptotic towards the x-axis. Once we know the initial value, the rest of the model is fairly easy to complete. In this case the initial value is the frequency at *time 0*. We employ the following simple exponential decay model: $$y = f(x) = ab^{x}$$  where $a > 0$  and $0 < b < 1$ . The variable $a$ is the y-intercept, and $b$ the rate of decline in time x. The rate of decline can take on any value between 0 and 1. The closer the value is to 1, the steeper the rate of decline."

    "\n",
    "From now on we are going to analyse the data from #EgyptAir only since there is far too little data for #EgyptAirHijack. Given the information we have for the first three time periods, we can fill in the linear and exponential models, and compare their predictions with our own findings. We use *Time 0* as the time at *t=0* and therefore as the constant, or intercept. In order to create these two models, we assume the data points in *Time 0, Time 1* and *Time 2* to be true, and use these to create the functions. In a second step, we are going to use our linear and exponential model to predict when the #EgyptAir hashtag will no longer be relevant among Twitter users. \n",

    "Based on the [frequency table](###Frequency Table) we created earlier, we are going to construct our linear and exponential decay functions which yield the frequencies for the hashtag #EgyptAir at any given time period. For these functions we use the frequencies in *Time 0* as the intercept value, so $a = 185$. Additionally, we need to calculate the value of $b$, by comparing data from (1) *Time 1* to *Time 0* and (2) from *Time 2* to *Time 0*. Below you will find the calculations for two linear decay functions with different values of $b$.  \n",

    "- we solve the function $y=185-bx$ for $y=80$ and $x=1$ (so at *Time 1*). The following command returns $b=105$. This leads us to our first linear decay function: $$ y_{EgyptAirLinear1} = 185 - 105x $$ \n"

    "# CONCLUSION\n",
    "In order to answer your [research question](#RESEARCH QUESTION), we have looked at two different models to predict when the Twitter trend in #EgyptAir will cease to exist: a linear decay model and an exponential decay model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The linear decay model predicts that the hashtag will cease to exist in the evening of March 29, the same day of the hijacking. The exponential decay model predicts that the hashtag will either cease to exist on April 2 at 11.00 or on April 3 at 20.00. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given our main [assumption](#ASSUMPTIONS), we conclude that our exponential decay model gives the most reliable results. Even though modern society tends towards shorter attention spands, we do not expect that disaster events will only be relevent to Social Media for a few hours. A span of several days seems much more plausible. \n"

    "# Discussion\n",
    "We are now going to shortly elaborate on our findings and discuss some elements on which we needed additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we would like to explain our data set. Mining data from Twitter turned out to be more difficult than anticipated. This difficulty is not only related to the amount of data one can mine, but also to the frequency at which we would have liked to have data. Our current data points are spaced out equally by 3 hours. To effectively model the decay trend however, it would have been useful to have frequency data that is less spaced out, such as every half hour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, to keep the analysis simple, we decided not to allow the hashtag #EgyptAir to re-trend. This is a major assumpion which simplifies our analysis, but does not necessarily correspond to real-life events. Based on this assumption, our model might not be directly applicable to current Twitter trends. However, we feel that our analysis has given us some important insight as to how quickly Twitter trends can decay and made us more aware of the limited attention span that current society exhibits.
