    "# RESEARCH QUESTION\n",
    "<br> How long does it take for the Twitter trend #EgyptAir to disappear?\n",
    "\n",
    "# MOTIVATION & INTRODUCTION\n",
    "<br> Social Media – a phenomenon of the 21st century. To some it is a red flag, but to most it represents an opportunity to engage in communication and to exchange information. Social media platforms include the social network [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook), the video-sharing website [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), the networking service [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn), the mobile photo-sharing service [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) or the microblogging service Twitter. Social media enables participants of its services or networks to simultaneously be producer, distributor and consumer of information. This means that users of social media engage in a flow of information on a scale and at a speed that were previously not possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within seconds of their occurrence, many news events become extremely popular among social media participants. This is especially visible in relation to disaster news, such as the terror attacks in Paris and [Brussels](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35872170). The intense media coverage right after the attacks captured our interest. People around the world shared their views and expressed solidarity with the victims and their families. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the constant flow of information, social media participants are likely to exhibit a limited attention span towards a single topic and are more prone to the symptom of “Quick News”. Hence, we are interested as to how quickly trends in social media can disappear again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate and predict how long it will take for the trend in the Twitter hash tag #EgyptAir to disappear. The hash tag refers to an Egypt Air flight, which was hijacked on March 29, 2016 and forced to divert to Cyprus instead of Cairo International Airport. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Twitter? ![alt text](http://www.cambridgema.gov/images/twitter-icon.png)\n",
    "<br> Twitter is an online microblogging service, which enables users to send and read short 140-character messages called “tweets”. Each user chooses to follow certain other users and their “tweets” about news, personal information or links to content such as images, video or articles. Has tags “#” are used to group posts together by a certain topic. “As of May 2915, Twitter has more than 500 million users, out of which more than 332 million are active.” (see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter>)"

We found the trend #EgyptAir to be trending that day, so we analysed the frequency of mentioning this hash tag (and similar ones) at multiple time periods.

    "- **Linear** decay shows a constant declining relationship between two variables. In this case we would see a constant declining relationship between *time* on the x-axis and *frequency* on the y-axis. The function for the linear decay model $$y = f(x) = a - bx$$  may be used as as simple declining model where $α > 0$ and $b > 0$ . A linear function has one independent variable and one dependent variable. The independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y. The constant term or the y-intercept is $a$, and it is the value of the dependent variable when x = 0. The coefficient of the independent variable, $b$ , is the slope of the function and gives the constant rate of change of the dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponential** decay shows a relative declining relationship between two variables. In this case we would see a relative declining relationship between *time* on the x-axis and *frequency* on the y-axis. Exponential decay models decrease very rapidly, and then level off to become asymptotic towards the x-axis. If you know the initial value then the rest of the model is fairly easy to complete. In this case the initial value is the amount of frequencies at *time 0*. The function for the exponential decay model is $$y = f(x) = ab^{x}$$  where $a > 0$  and $0 < b < 1$ . The variable $a$ is the y-intercept, and $b$ will be the rate of decline, in time x. Different values are available for the rate of decline, as long as they are between 0 and 1. The closer the value is to 1, the steeper the rate of decline.  \n",

We use *Time 0* as the time at *t=0* and therefore as the constant, or intercept. We also decide only to analyse the data from #EgyptAir since there is far too little data for #EgyptAirHijack. In order to create these two models, we assume the data points in *Time 0, Time 1* and *Time 2* to be true, and use these to create the functions. \n",

For this function we use the frequencies in *Time 0* as the intercept value, so $a = 185$. Additionally, we need to calculate the value of $b$, by comparing data from *Time 1* and *Time 2* to *Time 0*. Below you find the calculations of these two functions.  \n",
